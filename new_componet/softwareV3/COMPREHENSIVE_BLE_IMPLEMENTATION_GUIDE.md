## Dynamic BLE State Management

### Implementation Status
**Current Implementation**: Dynamic BLE state management is fully implemented and functional
- ‚úÖ Automatic BLE advertising stop during recording
- ‚úÖ Automatic BLE advertising restart after recording
- ‚úÖ Error recovery and state management
- ‚úÖ Integration with both button and BLE commands
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive logging and debugging

### Overview
The device implements intelligent BLE state management that automatically stops BLE advertising during audio recording to prevent RF interference and ensures clean audio capture.

### Implementation Details

#### Global State Variable
```c
static volatile bool s_is_recording = false;  // Made volatile for multi-task access
```

The `s_is_recording` variable is marked as `volatile` because it's accessed by multiple tasks (button handling, BLE callbacks, and main application logic).

#### Control Functions

##### `ble_stop_advertising()`
- Stops BLE advertising to prevent audio interference
- Called when recording starts
- Logs: `"Stopping BLE advertising to prevent audio interference"`
- Logs: `"BLE advertising stopped successfully"` on success or error code on failure

##### `ble_start_advertising_if_not_recording()`
- Conditionally starts BLE advertising only if not currently recording
- Prevents advertising restart during active recording
- Logs: `"Starting BLE advertising (not currently recording)"` or `"Skipping BLE advertising start (currently recording)"`

### Behavior Flow

#### Recording Start
1. **Stop BLE advertising** to prevent interference
2. Start audio capture and storage
3. Set `s_is_recording = true`
4. If recording fails, restart BLE advertising

#### Recording Stop
1. Stop audio capture and storage
2. Set `s_is_recording = false`
3. **Restart BLE advertising** now that recording is finished

#### BLE Callback Behavior
- **`ble_app_on_sync()`**: Only starts advertising if not recording
- **`ble_app_on_disconnect()`**: Only restarts advertising if not recording
- **`ble_app_on_adv_complete()`**: Only restarts advertising if not recording

### Benefits
1. **Clean Audio Signal**: BLE advertising is disabled during recording to prevent RF interference
2. **Predictable Behavior**: Device is only discoverable when not recording
3. **Automatic Management**: No manual intervention required - system handles BLE state automatically
4. **Error Recovery**: BLE advertising is restored if recording operations fail

### Log Messages

The implementation includes comprehensive logging:

- `"Stopping BLE advertising to prevent audio interference"`
- `"Starting BLE advertising (not currently recording)"`
- `"Skipping BLE advertising start (currently recording)"`
- `"BLE advertising stopped successfully"`
- `"Restart BLE advertising since recording failed"`
- `"BLE: Recording started via BLE command"`
- `"BLE: Recording stopped via BLE command"`
- `"BLE: Failed to start audio capture"`
- `"BLE: Failed to start recording storage"`
- `"BLE: Failed to stop recording"`

## File Transfer Protocol

### Implementation Status
**Current Implementation**: Basic file transfer protocol is fully implemented and functional
- ‚úÖ File transfer start/stop/abort commands
- ‚úÖ Data transfer in chunks (max 512 bytes)
- ‚úÖ Progress notifications every 1KB
- ‚úÖ Error handling and state management
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitation**: Uses fixed filename "ble_transfer.dat" and size 1024 bytes
- üîÑ **Future**: Dynamic filename and size support planned

### Protocol Flow

#### 1. Starting a File Transfer
1. Client writes `0x01` to File Control characteristic
2. Server creates new file on SD card (default: `ble_transfer.dat` with size 1024 bytes)
3. Server sends status notification: `ACTIVE` with offset=0, size=1024
4. Server ready to receive data
5. **Note**: Current implementation uses fixed filename and size - dynamic filename/size not yet implemented

#### 2. Transferring File Data
1. Client writes file data to File Data characteristic in chunks (max 512 bytes)
2. Server writes data to SD card file
3. Server tracks transfer progress (offset)
4. Server sends progress notifications every 1KB transferred

#### 3. Completing a File Transfer
1. Client writes `0x02` to File Control characteristic
2. Server closes the file
3. Server sends status notification: `COMPLETE` with final offset and size

#### 4. Aborting a File Transfer
1. Client writes `0x03` to File Control characteristic
2. Server closes the file and deletes it
3. Server sends status notification: `ERROR` with current offset and size

### State Management
```c
static uint16_t s_file_transfer_conn_handle = BLE_HS_CONN_HANDLE_NONE;
static uint16_t s_file_transfer_status_handle = 0;
static bool s_file_transfer_active = false;
static uint32_t s_file_transfer_size = 0;
static uint32_t s_file_transfer_offset = 0;
static char s_file_transfer_filename[128] = {0};
static FILE* s_file_transfer_fp = NULL;
```

### Key Functions

#### `file_transfer_start(const char* filename, uint32_t file_size)`
- Validates SD card availability
- Creates file on SD card with specified filename and size
- Initializes transfer state
- Sends initial status notification

#### `file_transfer_write_data(const uint8_t* data, uint16_t len)`
- Writes data chunks to SD card file
- Tracks transfer progress
- Sends progress notifications every 1KB transferred

#### `file_transfer_stop()`
- Closes the file
- Sends completion notification
- Resets transfer state

#### `file_transfer_abort()`
- Closes and deletes the file
- Sends error notification
- Resets transfer state

#### `file_transfer_notify_status(uint8_t status, uint32_t offset, uint32_t size)`
- Sends status notifications to connected client
- Includes current offset and total size

### Error Handling
- **SD Card Unavailable**: Returns error if SD card not mounted
- **File Creation Failure**: Returns error if file cannot be created
- **Write Failures**: Returns error if data cannot be written
- **Connection Loss**: Automatically aborts transfer if BLE connection lost
- **Transfer Already Active**: Returns error if trying to start transfer when one is already active
- **Transfer Not Active**: Returns error if trying to write data or stop transfer when none is active

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Historical Issues (Resolved)
**Previous Problem**: The ESP32-S3 device was not appearing in BLE scanner apps despite reaching the advertising stage.

**Root Causes Identified and Fixed**:
1. **Conditional Logic**: "BLE functionality removed - device operates in standalone mode" - This has been resolved
2. **Advertising Flags**: Conflicting `BLE_HS_ADV_F_DISC_LTD` flag removed, now using only `BLE_HS_ADV_F_DISC_GEN`
3. **Advertising Parameters**: All parameters now correctly configured for general discoverable mode

**Current Status**: All known BLE advertising issues have been resolved and the device should be discoverable when not recording.

### Common Issues
