# SalesTag Mobile App - Automated Agent Workflow Pipeline

**Date:** 2025-01-27
**Project:** SalesTag Mobile Companion App MVP
**Strategy:** Parallel Execution with Coordinator Agent

## Workflow Overview

**Human Input Phase:** âœ… COMPLETE - MVP defined in 30 minutes
**Automation Phase:** ðŸš€ STARTING NOW - Full agent-driven development

## Agent Pipeline Configuration

### Master Coordinator Agent (Mary - Business Analyst)
**Role:** Orchestrate all specialist agents and manage dependencies
**Responsibilities:**
- Validate MVP requirements completeness
- Manage agent-to-agent handoffs
- Resolve conflicts between parallel workstreams
- Ensure quality gates are met before progression
- Final integration validation

### Parallel Agent Execution Plan

#### Track 1: Technical Foundation Agent
**Agent:** Developer/Architect Agent
**Tasks:**
1. React Native project scaffolding with navigation
2. BLE connectivity module setup (react-native-ble-plx)
3. Local SQLite database schema implementation
4. Supabase client integration and auth setup
5. Audio playback component development

#### Track 2: UI/UX Design Agent  
**Agent:** Designer Agent
**Tasks:**
1. Single screen dashboard wireframe and layout
2. Professional UI component library selection
3. Status indicator design (battery/connection)
4. Recording list interface design
5. Audio player control implementation

#### Track 3: Integration & Testing Agent
**Agent:** QA/Testing Agent
**Tasks:**
1. BLE connectivity testing framework
2. Audio file handling validation
3. Cross-platform compatibility testing (iOS/Android)
4. Offline functionality validation
5. User acceptance testing preparation

## Dependencies and Synchronization

### Critical Path Dependencies:
1. **Foundation â†’ UI** - Technical scaffolding must exist before UI implementation
2. **Foundation â†’ Integration** - Core functionality needed before testing
3. **UI â†’ Integration** - Interface elements required for user testing

### Parallel Work Streams:
- **Concurrent Development** - UI design while technical foundation builds
- **Real-time Integration** - Testing agent validates work as it's completed
- **Continuous Quality Gates** - Each agent validates predecessor work

## Agent Handoff Protocols

### API Contracts Between Agents:
```typescript
// Foundation Agent Output
interface TechnicalFoundation {
  reactNativeVersion: string;
  bleModuleStatus: 'configured' | 'testing' | 'validated';
  databaseSchema: DatabaseSchema;
  supabaseConfig: SupabaseConfig;
  audioComponents: AudioComponent[];
}

// UI Agent Input/Output  
interface UIImplementation {
  screenLayout: ScreenLayout;
  componentLibrary: string;
  statusIndicators: StatusIndicator[];
  recordingListUI: RecordingListComponent;
  audioPlayerUI: AudioPlayerComponent;
}

// Integration Agent Output
interface TestingResults {
  bleConnectivityTest: TestResult;
  audioPlaybackTest: TestResult;
  crossPlatformTest: TestResult;
  offlineFunctionalityTest: TestResult;
  readyForDeployment: boolean;
}
```

## Quality Gates and Validation

### Gate 1: Technical Foundation Complete
**Criteria:**
- React Native project builds successfully on iOS + Android
- BLE module connects to test device
- Database schema creates and syncs with Supabase
- Audio playback functions with test files

### Gate 2: UI Implementation Complete  
**Criteria:**
- Single screen dashboard renders correctly
- Status indicators display mock data
- Recording list shows dummy entries
- Audio player controls respond to interactions

### Gate 3: Integration and Testing Complete
**Criteria:**
- End-to-end BLE connectivity validated
- Real audio files play successfully
- Cross-platform functionality confirmed
- Offline operation tested and verified

## Development Timeline

### Day 1: Foundation Sprint
- **Hours 1-4:** React Native scaffolding + BLE setup
- **Hours 5-8:** Database schema + Supabase integration
- **Parallel:** UI wireframes and component selection

### Day 2: Implementation Sprint  
- **Hours 1-4:** Core functionality implementation
- **Hours 5-8:** UI implementation and styling
- **Parallel:** Testing framework setup and initial tests

### Day 3: Integration and Deployment
- **Hours 1-4:** End-to-end integration testing
- **Hours 5-8:** Final validation and deployment preparation
- **Parallel:** Documentation and deployment pipeline

## Success Criteria

**MVP Deployment Ready:**
- âœ… Single screen dashboard functional
- âœ… BLE pairing and auto-reconnection working
- âœ… Audio file playback operational
- âœ… Battery and connection status displaying
- âœ… Local storage and basic file management
- âœ… Cross-platform iOS + Android compatibility

**Human Intervention Required:**
- App store deployment credentials
- Final approval for deployment
- User acceptance testing feedback
