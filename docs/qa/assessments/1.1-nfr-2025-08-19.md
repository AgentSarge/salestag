# NFR Assessment: 1.1

Date: 2025-08-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS — No network features enabled in MVP; no secrets stored
- Performance: CONCERNS — Throughput and power targets not yet validated
- Reliability: CONCERNS — Power-loss integrity and remount behavior not verified
- Maintainability: CONCERNS — Tests not implemented; initial scaffolding only

## Notes

- Targets for performance (max write latency, idle/armed mA) not yet defined; mark as CONCERNS until bench captured in `hardware-bench-template.md`
- Reliability requires power-loss test and SD re‑mount attempts under error conditions
- Maintainability will improve as unit/integration tests from test-design are implemented
