# NFR Assessment: S-REC-001

Date: 2025-08-19
Reviewer: Quinn

## Summary

- Security: PASS — No connectivity or secrets in scope for R0
- Performance: CONCERNS — Start latency ≤300 ms, LED off ≤200 ms, sustained file writes need validation
- Reliability: CONCERNS — Power-loss integrity and SPIFFS re-mount after crash must be verified
- Maintainability: CONCERNS — HAL seams present (GPIO, storage), but tests pending

## Evidence to Collect

- Monitor transcript with REC_START/REC_STOP, LED timings: `docs/qa/assessments/logs/R0_monitor.txt`
- First WAV file sample: `docs/qa/assessments/samples/R0_first.wav`
- SPIFFS info (total/used) logs after boot and after recording
- Power yank/reboot outcome (mount success log)
