## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID   | Category    | Description                                      | Prob | Impact | Score | Priority |
| --------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001  | Performance | SPIFFS/FATFS write latency causes audible gaps   | 2    | 3      | 6     | High     |
| POWER-001 | Power       | Start/stop spikes cause brownout or instability  | 2    | 3      | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001  | Data        | Power loss mid-write corrupts FS or file         | 2    | 2      | 4     | Medium   |
| OPS-001   | Operational | Debounce mis-tuned → false toggles               | 2    | 2      | 4     | Medium   |
| TECH-001  | Technical   | Incorrect pin mapping (IO4/IO40) blocks progress | 1    | 2      | 2     | Low      |
| REL-001   | Reliability | LED timing exceeds 200 ms on stop                | 1    | 2      | 2     | Low      |

## Mitigations

- PERF-001: Buffering strategy, write in chunks; avoid heavy fsync during stream; finalize header on stop only.
- POWER-001: Verify power rails; add delay to stagger capture start; measure current spike and adjust.
- DATA-001: Ensure clean close on stop; tolerate partial file on crash; mount with auto-format disabled for R0.
- OPS-001: Implement 5–20 ms debounce; log raw edges for tuning.
- TECH-001: Confirm pins per hardware doc before flashing.
- REL-001: Drive LED from state change ISR-safe signal.
