## Detailed Risk Register

| Risk ID  | Description                                  | Prob | Impact | Score | Priority |
| -------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---- | ------ | ----- | -------- |
| PERF-001 | SD throughput bursts drop pre/post roll data | 2    | 3      | 6     | High     |
| PERF-002 | VOX metering loop increases idle current     | 2    | 3      | 6     | High     |
| DATA-001 | Power loss during write leads to file issues | 2    | 2      | 4     | Medium   |
| BUS-001  | False triggers waste storage                 | 2    | 2      | 4     | Medium   |
| OPS-001  | Config drift NVS vs config.json              | 1    | 2      | 2     | Low      |

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- N/A

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- SD stress during frequent VOX start/stop; verify pre/post roll intact
- Measure idle vs armed current; confirm within target budget

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- Power loss while recording; validate header and playback
- Noise environments; tune thresholds to reduce false triggers
- Config sync test: change `config.json` and verify NVS update policy

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- None at this stage (monitor PERF risks closely)

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium/low risks with logs/monitoring

### Accepted Risks

- None

## Monitoring Requirements

- Buffer occupancy metrics; SD write latency histogram
- Battery draw in armed vs recording
- Error counts for mount/remount

## Risk Review Triggers

- Enabling BLE/Wiâ€‘Fi during armed state
- Increasing sample rate
- Changing SD card models
