## Risk Scoring Matrix

- **1-2**: Low Risk - Minimal impact, easy mitigation
- **3-4**: Medium Risk - Moderate impact, manageable mitigation
- **5-6**: High Risk - Significant impact, requires careful planning
- **7-8**: Critical Risk - Major impact, may require scope change

## Risk Assessment

### 1. Technical Risk: SD Card Mount Failures

- **Score**: 6 (High Risk)
- **Description**: SD card may fail to mount due to hardware issues, card corruption, or SPI configuration problems
- **Impact**: Complete loss of recording functionality
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement graceful fallback to internal flash
  - Add SD card health monitoring and recovery
  - Comprehensive error handling in mount process
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

### 2. Performance Risk: SPI Bus Conflicts

- **Score**: 5 (High Risk)
- **Description**: SPI bus configuration may conflict with other peripherals or cause timing issues
- **Impact**: Unreliable SD card communication, data corruption
- **Mitigation**:
  - Use dedicated SPI2_HOST to avoid conflicts
  - Implement proper SPI bus initialization and cleanup
  - Test with various SD card types and speeds
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

### 3. Data Risk: WAV File Corruption

- **Score**: 5 (High Risk)
- **Description**: Power loss during recording may corrupt WAV files or leave incomplete headers
- **Impact**: Unplayable audio files, user data loss
- **Mitigation**:
  - Implement periodic WAV header updates
  - Use fsync on critical boundaries
  - Add file integrity validation
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

### 4. Hardware Risk: SD Card Compatibility

- **Score**: 4 (Medium Risk)
- **Description**: Different SD card brands, speeds, and capacities may behave differently
- **Impact**: Inconsistent behavior across different cards
- **Mitigation**:
  - Test with multiple SD card types
  - Implement card detection and validation
  - Add compatibility logging
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

### 5. Operational Risk: User Error

- **Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Description**: Users may remove SD card during recording or insert incompatible cards
- **Impact**: Data loss, system crashes
- **Mitigation**:
  - Detect card removal and stop recording gracefully
  - Validate card before mounting
  - Clear user feedback and warnings
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

### 6. Power Risk: Increased Current Draw

- **Score**: 3 (Medium Risk)
- **Description**: SD card operations may increase power consumption during recording
- **Impact**: Reduced battery life, potential brownouts
- **Mitigation**:
  - Monitor power consumption during SD operations
  - Implement power-aware write strategies
  - Test with various power supply conditions
- **Owner**: Development Team
- **Status**: Active

## Overall Risk Assessment

- **Total Risk Score**: 26/48
- **Risk Level**: Medium-High
- **Recommendation**: Proceed with development, but implement all identified mitigations

## Risk Mitigation Summary

1. **Immediate Actions**: Implement graceful fallback and error handling
