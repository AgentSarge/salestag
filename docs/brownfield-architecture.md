# SalesTag Brownfield Architecture Document

## Introduction

This document captures the **CURRENT STATE** of the SalesTag firmware codebase as of August 2025. SalesTag is a door-to-door sales conversation recording system built on ESP32-S3 hardware with dual microphone audio capture and SD card storage. This brownfield analysis documents what EXISTS today, including the simplified diagnostic build currently implemented.

### Document Scope

**Focused on current firmware implementation** - The codebase contains a working ESP32-S3 firmware foundation with basic audio recording, button control, and SD card storage. The PRD outlines a complete IoT ecosystem with mobile app and BLE communication, but the current implementation is a simplified diagnostic version focusing on core hardware functionality.

## Data Models and Current File Structure

### Audio File Storage (Current Implementation)

**SD Card Organization**:
```text
/sdcard/
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ rec/                     # Recording directory
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recording_001.wav    # WAV files with sequential naming
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ recording_002.wav
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ [timestamp metadata as future enhancement]
```

**WAV File Format** (Actual Implementation):
- Sample Rate: 16kHz
- Bit Depth: 16-bit
- Channels: 2 (stereo - dual microphone)
- Format: PCM uncompressed
- File naming: Sequential numbering (recording_XXX.wav)

### Hardware Pin Configuration (Actual)

```c
// GPIO pin assignments (from sd_storage.h and main.c)
#define BUTTON_GPIO    4     // Button input with pullup
#define LED_GPIO       40    // Status LED output
#define SD_CS_PIN      39    // SD card chip select
#define SD_MOSI_PIN    35    // SD card SPI MOSI
#define SD_MISO_PIN    37    // SD card SPI MISO  
#define SD_SCLK_PIN    36    // SD card SPI clock
#define MIC1_ADC_CH    3     // GPIO 9 - Microphone 1 (ADC1_CH3)

```

## Technical Debt and Current Implementation Gaps

### Current Limitations (vs. PRD Requirements)

1. **Audio Capture**: ADC-based microphone reading is stubbed - generates silence instead of actual audio
2. **Recording Duration**: No 10-second automatic stop implementation in current main.c
3. **BLE Communication**: Complete BLE stack missing from current build
4. **Power Management**: Basic GPIO control only, no deep sleep implementation
5. **File Metadata**: WAV files lack timestamp and metadata structure defined in PRD
6. **Mobile Integration**: No companion app exists yet

### Implementation Gaps Requiring Development

1. **Real Audio Capture**: MAX9814 amplifier integration with ESP32-S3 ADC needs implementation
2. **BLE Peripheral Mode**: ESP32-S3 BLE stack configuration for mobile pairing
3. **Recording State Machine**: Current main.c is simple GPIO test, needs full recorder integration
4. **File Transfer Protocol**: BLE characteristic definition for audio file chunks
5. **Power Optimization**: Deep sleep modes and battery monitoring via ADC
6. **Security**: Audio file encryption and secure BLE pairing

### Working Components Ready for Integration

1. **SD Card Storage**: Fully functional SPI-based storage with FAT32 filesystem
2. **GPIO Interface**: Button debouncing and LED control working reliably
3. **WAV File Generation**: Header creation and streaming write capability implemented
4. **FreeRTOS Foundation**: Task management and queuing infrastructure in place
5. **Build System**: ESP-IDF toolchain configured with proper partition layout

## Known Issues and Workarounds

### Current Implementation Issues

1. **Audio Capture Placeholder**: `audio_capture.c` generates silence - real microphone input needs ADC implementation
2. **No Recording Duration Control**: Current main.c doesn't implement 10-second auto-stop
3. **Missing BLE Stack**: Diagnostic build intentionally excludes wireless communication
4. **No File Metadata**: WAV files lack timestamp information required by PRD data schema

### Development Workarounds

- **SD Card Testing**: Use pre-formatted FAT32 card, device handles mounting automatically
- **Audio Testing**: Current silence generation allows testing WAV file structure
- **GPIO Validation**: Button press immediately toggles LED for hardware verification
- **Build Issues**: Use exact ESP-IDF v5.2.2 - newer versions may have compatibility issues

## Appendix - Essential Commands and Troubleshooting

### Development Commands

```bash
# Build and flash workflow
idf.py clean                     # Clean previous builds
idf.py set-target esp32s3        # Set target chip
idf.py menuconfig               # Configure build options (optional)
idf.py build                    # Compile firmware
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 flash    # Flash to device (adjust port)
idf.py -p /dev/ttyACM0 monitor  # Monitor serial output
```

### Hardware Debugging

- **Button Issues**: Check GPIO 4 pullup resistor, verify 3.3V logic levels
- **LED Problems**: Confirm GPIO 40 connection, check current limiting resistor
- **SD Card Failures**: Verify SPI wiring, ensure FAT32 format, check 3.3V power
- **Serial Debug**: Use `ESP_LOGI(TAG, "message")` for debugging, view via `idf.py monitor`

### Expected Serial Output (Working System)

```text
=== SalesTag Simple Test - Button + LED Only ===
BOOT: Starting simple button test...
GPIO configured - Button: GPIO[4], LED: GPIO[40]
