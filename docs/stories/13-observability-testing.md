# 13. Observability & Testing

- On‑device logs with rotation; optional BLE log streaming
- Test plan:
  - Audio pipeline throughput tests at target rates
  - Power loss during record → file validity
  - SD stress (insert/remove, long recordings)
  - Sleep/wake latency, battery draw in each state
  - Provisioning flows (BLE/Wi‑Fi) where enabled
