# 8. Non‑Functional

- Robustness: no corruption on power loss (periodic header updates, fsync on split/stop)
- Throughput: sustain stereo 16‑bit at selected sample rate
- Latency: record start < 500 ms from button
- Battery life: targets — >8 h idle, >2–4 h continuous record (to be validated)
- Security: encrypted provisioning channels; TLS for OTA/upload when added
