# ðŸŽ¯ Firmware Team Discussion Quick Reference

## **TOP 3 QUESTIONS TO ASK FIRST:**

### **1. Data Corruption Protection**
**"Do you have any checksums or error detection on BLE transfers?"**
- If NO: This is likely the root cause
- If YES: Ask about implementation details

### **2. ADC Value Validation**
**"Why are we seeing 65535 (0xFFFF) values from the ADC?"**
- 12-bit ADC should only output 0-4095
- 0xFFFF suggests uninitialized memory or overflow

### **3. Header Corruption**
**"Why is 'RAWA' becoming 'AWAR' during BLE transfer?"**
- Byte order issue or corruption during transmission
- Check endianness and BLE packet fragmentation

## **CRITICAL EVIDENCE TO SHOW:**

```
Header: Expected "RAWA" (0x52415741) â†’ Got "AWAR" (0x41574152)
ADC Values: 16.7% are 65535 (0xFFFF) - IMPOSSIBLE for 12-bit ADC
Timestamps: Values like 1,600,000,000 ms (18.5 days)
```

## **FIRMWARE DEBUGGING CHECKLIST:**

### **Immediate Actions:**
- [ ] Add ESP32-side data logging before BLE transmission
- [ ] Verify ADC readings are within 0-4095 range
- [ ] Add checksums to BLE packets
- [ ] Test with minimal BLE packet sizes

### **Root Cause Analysis:**
- [ ] Check for buffer overflows in BLE transmission code
- [ ] Verify memory allocation for audio buffers
- [ ] Test BLE connection stability under load
- [ ] Monitor for ESP32 memory corruption

### **Data Flow Verification:**
```
ADC Reading â†’ Buffer Storage â†’ BLE Transmission â†’ Mobile Reception
     â†“            â†“              â†“              â†“
  0-4095    Valid data     No corruption  Valid data
```

## **EXPECTED FIRMWARE RESPONSES:**

### **If they say "BLE is fine":**
- Ask for BLE packet logs
- Request raw data dumps before BLE send
- Suggest adding data validation

### **If they find a bug:**
- Great! They'll fix the corruption at source
- Ask for timeline and testing plan

### **If they need more data:**
- Use the `ble_data_analyzer.py` script
- Provide sample corrupted files
- Share this investigation document

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA:**
- [ ] ADC values stay within 0-4095 range
- [ ] Headers remain as "RAWA"
- [ ] Timestamps are sequential and reasonable
- [ ] No more 0xFFFF values in data stream

## **FOLLOW-UP ACTIONS:**
1. **After meeting:** Document what they commit to fixing
2. **Next steps:** Schedule follow-up to verify fixes
3. **Testing:** Use analyzer script to validate improvements
4. **Monitoring:** Set up ongoing corruption detection

---
**Remember:** The issue is likely in the ESP32 firmware's BLE transmission or data handling, not the audio processing logic we've been working on. ðŸŽ¯
