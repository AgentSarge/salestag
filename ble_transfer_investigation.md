# ðŸš¨ BLE Transfer Data Corruption Investigation

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT**
Data corruption during BLE transfer between ESP32 and mobile device, causing:
- Header corruption (RAWA â†’ AWAR)
- Impossible timestamps (1.6B ms)
- Extreme ADC values (65535/0xFFFF = 16.7% of samples)
- Sample count misalignment

## **CRITICAL QUESTIONS FOR FIRMWARE TEAM**

### **1. BLE Transfer Data Integrity**
- **"Is there any data corruption protection in the BLE transfer?"**
- **"Are you using checksums, CRCs, or error correction?"**
- **"What happens if a BLE packet is corrupted or dropped?"**

### **2. Data Format Verification**
- **"Can you confirm the exact byte order and endianness?"**
- **"Are you sure the header should be 'RAWA' and not 'AWAR'?"**
- **"Why are we seeing impossible timestamps (1.6 billion ms) and sample counts (570 million)?"**

### **3. BLE Transfer Issues**
- **"Are you experiencing BLE connection drops or timeouts?"**
- **"What's the BLE packet size and transfer rate?"**
- **"Are there any known issues with large file transfers over BLE?"**

### **4. Data Validation**
- **"Do you validate the data before sending it over BLE?"**
- **"Are there any sanity checks for ADC values (0-4095 range)?"**
- **"Why are we getting 65535 values (0xFFFF) - is this a firmware bug?"**

### **5. Debugging Information**
- **"Can you add logging to see what data is being sent vs. received?"**
- **"Are there any error counters or status indicators?"**
- **"Can you verify the data integrity on the ESP32 side before BLE transmission?"**

## **KEY EVIDENCE TO SHARE**

### **Header Corruption**
```
Expected: "RAWA" (0x52415741)
Received: "AWAR" (0x41574152)
Issue: Byte order reversal or corruption during transfer
```

### **Extreme ADC Values**
```
Problem: 16.7% of samples = 65535 (0xFFFF)
Expected: 0-4095 (12-bit ADC range)
Issue: Possibly uninitialized memory or buffer overflow
```

### **Impossible Timestamps**
```
Problem: Timestamps like 1,600,000,000 ms (18.5 days)
Expected: Sequential timestamps from recording start
Issue: Possible integer overflow or corrupted data
```

### **Data Misalignment**
```
Problem: Sample counts don't match expected sequence
Issue: Packet loss or corruption during BLE transfer
```

## **REQUESTED ACTIONS**

### **Immediate (High Priority)**
1. **Add CRC32 checksums** to each BLE packet
2. **Implement data validation** before BLE transmission
3. **Add ESP32-side logging** of data before BLE send
4. **Verify ADC value ranges** (0-4095) before processing

### **Short Term (Medium Priority)**
1. **Implement retry logic** for failed/corrupted transfers
2. **Add error detection** and recovery mechanisms
3. **Monitor BLE connection stability** and packet loss
4. **Test with smaller BLE packet sizes**

### **Debugging Support Needed**
1. **Raw data logging** from ADC â†’ Processing â†’ BLE transmission
2. **BLE packet capture** to analyze corruption patterns
3. **Memory dump** of buffers before/after BLE transfer
4. **Timestamp generation** verification

## **EXPECTED OUTCOMES**
- Identify root cause of data corruption
- Implement data integrity protection
- Verify BLE transfer reliability
- Establish monitoring for future issues

## **SUCCESS CRITERIA**
- [ ] No more 0xFFFF values in ADC data
- [ ] Consistent "RAWA" headers
- [ ] Sequential, reasonable timestamps
- [ ] Sample counts match expected values
- [ ] BLE transfer reliability > 99.9%
